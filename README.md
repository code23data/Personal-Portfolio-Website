# Personal Portfolio Website

A sleek, responsive, and interactive personal portfolio built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project serves as a professional hub to showcase my software development journey, projects, and contact information.

## Features

- **Flat File Structure:** Simplified directory for easy deployment and management.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop views.
- **JavaScript Form Validation:** Ensures all messages from the contact form are complete and valid.
- **Smooth Navigation:** Seamless scrolling between sections with an active-link highlighter.

## Project Structure

All files are located in the root directory for simplicity:

* `index.html` — The main structure of the website (Home, About, Projects, Contact).
* `style.css` — All custom styles, layout rules, and responsive media queries.
* `main.js` — JavaScript logic for form validation and UI interactivity.
* `resume.pdf` — The downloadable version of my professional resume.

## Built With

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure for SEO and accessibility.
* **CSS3:** Flexbox and Grid for layout.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** DOM manipulation for smooth scrolling and form logic.
